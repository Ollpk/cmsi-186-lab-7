# CMSI 186 Lab 7 Little Ratties

In this repository, I managed to complete a program that enables for the user to be able to have any maze solved based on their user input. This program is able to take any list of characters in a string or any list of characters in a document and be able to process and determine whether a maze can be created and in whether the maze can be solved or not. The program works by consistently checking whether it can move into the next avilable space, while tabulating the move itself and noting it as the past move to use in case the next move leads into a dead end and the wrong path.
